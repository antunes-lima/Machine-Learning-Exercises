# Machine-Learning-Exercises

———————————————————————————————
  
Exercises of Machine Learning, using Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. 
  
Made using Python Jupyter Notebooks. Using a Bank dataset to predict churn, with the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. Using the California House Prices dataset to predict house values, with the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. Both exercises includes parameters optimization, using the Grid Search Cross-Validation method.
